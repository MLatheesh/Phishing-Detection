# Phishing Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques. Phishing websites are fraudulent websites that attempt to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, and financial information from users. By developing a model that can accurately identify phishing websites, we can help users protect themselves from online threats.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of features extracted from websites, including information such as domain age, URL length, and presence of HTTPS. Each website in the dataset is labeled as either legitimate or phishing. The dataset has been preprocessed to remove any missing values or irrelevant features to ensure the quality of the model.

## Methodology
The project involves several steps in building the phishing detection model:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.
2. Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the detection of phishing websites.
3. Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm for training the model.
4. Model Training: Training the selected model on the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
After training and evaluating the model, we have achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting phishing websites. The model demonstrates the ability to distinguish between legitimate and phishing websites with high precision and recall, making it a reliable tool for identifying online threats.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project showcases the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting phishing websites. By utilizing the features extracted from websites and training a model on a labeled dataset, we can develop a robust tool for protecting users from fraudulent online activities. This project contributes to enhancing cybersecurity measures and promoting a safer online environment for users.
